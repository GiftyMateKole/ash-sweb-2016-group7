users class

This class contains functions that would enable the user search for data from the Ashesi Clinic database. 
Some functions take in parameters whiles some do not take in parameters. 
The ones that take in parameters return specific information about an individual in the database based on the Id it receives.
The remaining that do not take parameters would return the entire record from the database. In this case, the information would be on
a particular table.

The functions:
getAllDiagnosis()
getPatientInfo()
getPatient($filter)
getHospital()
getDiagnosis($diagnosis)
searchPatient($text)
